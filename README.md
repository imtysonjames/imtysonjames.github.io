## Assumptions

- Responsive at varying breakpoints, not just one breakpoint per device
- Higher resolution devices will need higher quality images

## Reason for approach

Flexbox seemed the most efficient way of achieving the goal set out in brief, it has a lot of flexibility for adapting to change when/if changes are made to design and is key for responsive development a lot of the time.

## What could've been better with more time

- Could have experimented with percentages and columns
- Additional breakpoints to account more accurately for devices - there a lot of varying device sizes, I feel like this can always be better
- Accomodate for higher resolutions, create higher quality images through photoshop and include with media queries
